this program will
get the list of all pods and services running on a cluster
as well as their yaml file
and also tell which pods and svcs are related
it will all be displayed on a react webpage
and then maybe i package this app as a pod itself
and manage the whole thing using an operator

some branches contain extra code that can get list and manifest files of all the resources
